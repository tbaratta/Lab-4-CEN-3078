## Code Security Practices

- **Static Analysis Integration:**  
  Integrated static analysis tools like [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) to automatically scan for security vulnerabilities, bad coding practices, and potential code smells. This helps in identifying issues early in the development process.
  
- **Code Review Process:**  
  Enforced a mandatory code review process for all pull requests (PRs) to ensure that all code changes adhere to secure coding standards. Code is reviewed for potential vulnerabilities, performance issues, and overall code quality.

- **Security Best Practices:**  
  Provided the development team with guidelines on secure coding practices, ensuring all team members are aware of common security pitfalls and how to avoid them. This includes proper handling of sensitive data, input validation, and avoiding common security risks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

- **Continuous Security Monitoring:**  
  Configured the CI/CD pipeline to run security scans with each code change. Vulnerabilities are flagged automatically, allowing for quicker remediation of issues before they reach production.

### 🔒 Secure Code Quality
- Implemented automated **static analysis** as part of the CI pipeline to detect vulnerabilities and bad coding practices early in development.
- Enforced **secure coding practices training** to improve awareness and ensure high-quality, security-compliant code submissions.

### 🛡️ Vulnerability Management
- Integrated **automated vulnerability scanning tools** (e.g., [Snyk](https://snyk.io/)) to detect security flaws in dependencies.
- Established a **policy for regular dependency updates** and timely patching of known vulnerabilities to reduce security risks.

### 🏗️ Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
- Adopted **SCA tools** such as [OWASP Dependency-Check](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/) and Black Duck to audit open-source dependencies.
- Ensured that **third-party libraries are regularly reviewed and updated** to align with the latest security patches and best practices.
